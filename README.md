# algorithmPractice
Just code I've written to practice. Please don't take it seriously...

I've been trying to learn more about coding, and algorithms to better improve my coding skills.
I want to apply these skills into game development, and personal projects.
I'm still very new to this, but hopefully I'll be able to join competitive programming!
I've bought some books for software engineering, and wow it's lot!
Using Github is mostly a new experience for me. I don't even know what I'm doing!
